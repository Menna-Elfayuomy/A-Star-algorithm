# A Star algorithm on autonomous mobile robot <br/>
## Intro. 
That project is a part of my work in my Graduation project on a fully autonomous multi-agent robots. <br />
Main objective from the project is implementing a formation algorithm on the whole robots & developing different algorithms to reach approach of making each robot of them fully autonomous.<br /> 
That algorithms used to make each of them fully autonomous are:<br/>
- motion control algorithm 
- go to goal algorithm 
- localization algorithm using a perception data from an overhead camera 
- mapping representation 
- path planning algorithm           **that algorithm is the one included in that repo.**<br/> <br/>

## Description of the A Star algorithm provided
The A* (pronounced A-star) algorithm used in the autonomous systems to generate a free-from collision path for a robot starting from its current position to a desired goal point. <br/>  
My code depends on two main pieces of data which are the current location of the robot relative to a global reference position and the robot environment representation (will be called the map). <br/>
