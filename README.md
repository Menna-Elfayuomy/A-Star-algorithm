# A-Star-algorithm
## Description 
That project is a part of my work in my Graduation project on a fully autonomus multi-agent robots. 
Main objective from the project is implementing a formation algorithm on the whole robots in addition to development of the algorithms that makes each robot of them fully autonomous. 
That algorithms used to make each of them fully autonomous are:
the motion control algorithm, the go to goal algorithm, the localization algorithm using a preception data from an overhead camera, the mapping representation and finally the path planning algorithm.
