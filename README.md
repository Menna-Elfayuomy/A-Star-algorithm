# A-Star-algorithm
## Description 
That project is a part of my work in my Graduation project on a fully autonomus multi-agent robots. <br />
Main objective from the project is implementing a formation algorithm on the whole robots & developing different algorithms to reach approach of making each robot of them fully autonomous.<br /> 
That algorithms used to make each of them fully autonomous are:<br/>
the motion control algorithm, the go to goal algorithm, the localization algorithm using a preception data from an overhead camera, the mapping representation and finally the path planning algorithm.
