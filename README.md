# A-Star-algorithm
## Intro. 
That project is a part of my work in my Graduation project on a fully autonomus multi-agent robots. <br />
Main objective from the project is implementing a formation algorithm on the whole robots & developing different algorithms to reach approach of making each robot of them fully autonomous.<br /> 
That algorithms used to make each of them fully autonomous are:<br/>
- motion control algorithm 
- go to goal algorithm 
- localization algorithm using a preception data from an overhead camera 
- mapping representation 
- path planning algorithm           **that algorithm is the one includede in that reposatory**<br/>
